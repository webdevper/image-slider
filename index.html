                        In response to the lack of Black characters in comics, Lee and Kirby created T’Challa, the prince of Wakanda, a country with a mix of futuristic technology and traditional life due to its Vibranium resources. After his father's death at the hands of Ulysses Klaw, T’Challa became king and the Black Panther. Enhanced by a mystical herb, T’Challa gained near-superhuman strength and agility. Deciding to use his powers for all humanity, he left Wakanda for New York after meeting the Fantastic Four.
